###SYNOPSIS
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.  

I have conducted the following research using the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) [47MB] from the NOAA Storm Database. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete. 

We are seeking to answer the following two questions with this information to help prevent, detect, and predict the impact on human lives as well as cost to our economy based on severe weather events.

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the 𝙴𝚅𝚃𝚈𝙿𝙴 variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?  

###RESULTS

Based on our Reproducible Research below - we have discovered the following:  

- **Tornados** are the most harmful severe weather events to population health with respect to highest number of fatalities and injuries
- **Floods** are the most expensive severe weather events that have the greatest economic consequences

###DATA PROCESSING

**Download the file**  
We will start by downloading the NOAA file from the link above, and store it to an R object "NOAA."
``` {r echo=TRUE}
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", destfile = "stormData.csv.bz2", method = "curl")
NOAA <- read.csv(bzfile("stormData.csv.bz2"), sep=",", header=T)
unlink(temp)

## View Dimensions of the data
dim(NOAA)

## View header
head(NOAA)
```
 
We see that there is data we want to isolate for this particular analysis of damage based on EVTYPE (event type), FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG (property damage), PROPDMGEXP (property damage expense), CROPDMG (crop damage), and CROPDMGEXP (crop damage expense). We will isolate this data and store it in r object called "NOAA_1." 

``` {r echo=TRUE}
NOAA_1 <- NOAA[,c('EVTYPE','FATALITIES','INJURIES', 'PROPDMG', 'PROPDMGEXP', 'CROPDMG', 'CROPDMGEXP')]

## View headers in revised data set
head(NOAA_1)
```

Data looks a lot better now! We will now convert the PROPDMGEXP & CROPDMGEXP fields to tangible numbers where H (hundreds = 10^2), K (thousands = 10^3), M (millions = 10^6), and B (billions = 10^9) based on [Wikipedia power of 10 table.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_10)

``` {r echo=TRUE}
## Convert Property Damage 
NOAA_1$PROPDMGDOLLARS = 0
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$PROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$PROPDMG * 10^2
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$PROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$PROPDMG * 10^3
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$PROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$PROPDMG * 10^6
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$PROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$PROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$PROPDMG * 10^9

## Convert Crop Damage 
NOAA_1$CROPDMGDOLLARS = 0
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$CROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "H", ]$CROPDMG * 10^2
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$CROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "K", ]$CROPDMG * 10^3
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$CROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "M", ]$CROPDMG * 10^6
NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$CROPDMGDOLLARS = NOAA_1[NOAA_1$CROPDMGEXP == "B", ]$CROPDMG * 10^9

## View revised headers of NOAA_1
head(NOAA_1)
```

Now we have all of our data in a neat table:  

- Event Types (EVTYPE) 
- Fatalities
- Injuries
- Property Damage (PROPDMG)
- Property Damage Expense by symbol (PROPDMGEXP)
- Crop Damage (CROPDMG)
- Crop Damage Expense by symbol (CROPDMGEXP)
- Property Damage in Dollars by power of 10 (PROPDMGDOLLARS)
- Crop Damage in Dollars by power of 10 (CROPDMGDOLLARS)

We will now use the data to answer the questions.

###**Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the 𝙴𝚅𝚃𝚈𝙿𝙴 variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?**

``` {r echo=TRUE}
## Load the appropriate libraries in R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

## Organize type of event ~ fatalities and store in object "fatalities" & same for "injuries"
fatalities <- aggregate(FATALITIES ~ EVTYPE, data=NOAA_1, sum)
injuries <- aggregate(INJURIES ~ EVTYPE, data = NOAA_1, sum)

## Sort fatalities
fatalities <- fatalities[order(-fatalities$FATALITIES), ][1:20, ]
fatalities$EVTYPE <- factor(fatalities$EVTYPE, levels = fatalities$EVTYPE)
head(fatalities)

## Sort Injuries
injuries <- injuries[order(-injuries$INJURIES), ][1:20, ]
injuries$EVTYPE <- factor(injuries$EVTYPE, levels = injuries$EVTYPE)
head(injuries)

## Plot using ggplot2
p1 = ggplot(fatalities, aes(x = EVTYPE, y = FATALITIES, theme_set(theme_bw()))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orange") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 6)) + 
    xlab("Event Type") + ylab("Fatalities") + ggtitle("Fatalities by top 20 Weather Event Types") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))

p2 = ggplot(injuries, aes(x = EVTYPE, y = INJURIES, theme_set(theme_bw()))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "pink") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 6)) + 
    xlab("Event Type") + ylab("Injuries") + ggtitle("Injuries by top 20 Weather Event Types") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))

## Plot both side by side using gridExtra package
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2, top = "Most Harmful Events with Respect to Population Health")
```

By this chart we can conclude that **Tornado** as an event type has the highest level of Fatalities and Injuries. 

###**Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?**

``` {r echo=TRUE}
## Organize Property & Crop to Event Type and store in object "damage"
damage <- aggregate(PROPDMGDOLLARS + CROPDMGDOLLARS ~ EVTYPE, data=NOAA_1, sum)
names(damage) = c("EVENT_TYPE", "TOTAL_DAMAGE")
## Sort 
damage <- damage[order(-damage$TOTAL_DAMAGE), ][1:20, ]
damage$EVENT_TYPE <- factor(damage$EVENT_TYPE, levels = damage$EVENT_TYPE)

## Check headers
head(damage)

## Plot using ggplot2
ggplot(damage, aes(x = EVENT_TYPE, y = TOTAL_DAMAGE, theme_set(theme_bw()))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
    xlab("Event Type") + ylab("Total Damage in $USD") + ggtitle("Total Property & Crop Damage by top 20 Weather Events")
```

Based on this chart we can concluded the the highest cost event type is **Flood**. This has the greatest (adverse) economic impact.

**Assignment**

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

**Requirements**

For this assignment you will need some specific tools

- RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.
- knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML

**Document Layout**

- Language: Your document should be written in English.
- Title: Your document should have a title that briefly summarizes your data analysis
- Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.
- There should be a section titled Data Processing which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the 𝚌𝚊𝚌𝚑𝚎 = 𝚃𝚁𝚄𝙴 option for certain code chunks.
- There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.
You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
- The analysis document must have at least one figure containing a plot.
- Your analysis must have no more than three figures. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
- You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that 𝚎𝚌𝚑𝚘 = 𝚃𝚁𝚄𝙴 for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).

**Publishing Your Analysis**

For this assignment you will need to publish your analysis on RPubs.com. If you do not already have an account, then you will have to create a new account. After you have completed writing your analysis in RStudio, you can publish it to RPubs by doing the following:

1. In RStudio, make sure your R Markdown document (.𝚁𝚖𝚍) document is loaded in the editor

2. Click the 𝙺𝚗𝚒𝚝 𝙷𝚃𝙼𝙻 button in the doc toolbar to preview your document.

3. In the preview window, click the 𝙿𝚞𝚋𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚑 button.

Once your document is published to RPubs, you should get a unique URL to that document. **Make a note of this URL** as you will need it to submit your assignment.

**NOTE:** If you are having trouble connecting with RPubs due to proxy-related or other issues, you can upload your final analysis document file as a PDF to Coursera instead.

**Submitting Your Assignment**

In order to submit this assignment, you must copy the RPubs URL for your completed data analysis document in to the peer assessment question.

If you choose to submit as a PDF, please insert an obvious placeholder URL (e.g. https://google.com) in order to allow submission.
